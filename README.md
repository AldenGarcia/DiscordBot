## Introduction
Discord bots are all over the internet, but if you don't want to start from scratch, go ahead and download this code to have a basis for your own bot. A lot of the commands remain from old commits, and you can freely re-purpose them for your own commands. I wish you luck on making your own bot, have a nice day.

## Personal Information
This is the current state of my discord bot, it's going to have more features in the future. For obvious reasons, I removed my bots token from the code. I plan to implement a number of things, which I have all referenced [here](https://aldengarcia.github.io/).
Although I uploaded the source code for my bot, github wont allow me to upload my JS framework files. If anyone is wondering, the framework i'm using is Node.JS with Discord.JS.
My JSON config files are also not linked because I didn't want to link them, have a nice day.
