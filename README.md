## Introduction
Discord bots are all over the internet, but if you don't want to start from scratch, go ahead and download this code to have a basis for your own bot. A lot of the commands remain from old commits, and you can freely re-purpose them for your own commands. I wish you luck on making your own bot, have a nice day.

### Getting Started
Instructions needed to run the project:

## Installations

1. [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/): I used Node for the backend, and you will need it in order to run the bot. Refer to [this](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) site for the Node.js install.
2. `Folder`: A folder containing the source code needs to be created, I reccomend naming it "DiscordBot", but you can choose whatever you prefer. In addition, you need to find, and save the directory because it's needed throughout starting, and testing the bot.
3. [`NPM`](https://www.npmjs.com/): For those of you that don't already have it, you will need to also install NPM. (It's a package manager that you will use to install all packages within the project.)

## Terminal Commands (You will need to utelize the terminal for this.)
* `cd (required directory)`: Remember the folder you made for the bot? You will need to find which directory it's under, and type: cd (directory label). This can vary, so make sure you're using the correct characters for your operating system.
* `NPM init`: Starts a new

## Dependency Management

## Personal Information
This is the current state of my discord bot, it's going to have more features in the future. For obvious reasons, I removed my bots token from the code. I plan to implement a number of things, which I have all referenced [here](https://aldengarcia.github.io/).
Although I uploaded the source code for my bot, github wont allow me to upload my JS framework files. If anyone is wondering, the framework i'm using is Node.JS with Discord.JS.
My JSON config files are also not linked because I didn't want to link them, have a nice day.
