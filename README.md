# Guppy
Guppy is an interactive discord bot that handles basic management of Discord servers. I use it to manage my own, but it's still in development; Hence, being online all the time is not something that happens frequently. If you'd like to grab a simple boilerplate to emulate some aspects of my bot, go [here](https://github.com/rampus-bit/DiscordBot-Sapling). Many more commands are pending, I just have to work on them a bit more. All files exist with the acception of my node folders. If you want to take any code, remember that some files include ID's specific to my server, so they might not work for you.

## Functionality
Small list of commands. Some other commands are available, but I haven't implemented them into '-help' yet.
