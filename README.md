# DiscordBot
This is the current state of my discord bot, it's going to have more features in the future. For obvious reasons, I removed my bots token from the code. I plan to implement a number of things, which I have all referenced [here](https://aldengarcia.github.io/).
Although I uploaded the source code for my bot, github wont allow me to upload my JS framework files. If anyone is wondering, the framework i'm using is Node.JS with Discord.JS.
My JSON config files are also not linked because I didn't want to link them, have a nice day.
